# Online-Modelling-Platform-for-Algal-Bloom-Transport-and-Dispersion
This web-based modelling platform seamlessly couples hydrodynamic-meteorological models, particle-tracking model, remote sensing, and GIS technologies into one application for the entire workflows of HABs transport and dispersion simulation within the ocean modelling community.

The presented modelling framework provides a one-stop platform for HABs transport and dispersion simulation, while avoiding complex and tedious pre and post-processing tasks, and facilitates the user to collaboratively operate the model, including model configuration and execution, visualisation and validation of the simulation results, simulation scenarios management, spatial analysis, and publishing an HABs warning bulletin in the same framework under the web environment. 

The main interface of the web-based modelling platform is illustrated below. The GUIs comprised of a map viewer window and several toolsets that allowed users to perform various operations on a single web page.

In Bloom directory is the front-end file of the project.
In Bloom_ Server directory is the back-end file of the project.
inbloom.sql is the supporting database storage structure and data.
Some examples are shown as follows:
